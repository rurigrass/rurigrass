My name is Ruairidh and I'm a software developer based in Prague.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MemeMappr, It's a GeoGuessr type game in which the user has to guess the location of each Meme the game shows you. It will be big when I finish it, I promise!

ðŸŒ± Currently playing around with:
Next 14, Tanstack, Prisma, AuthJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Three.js and so many more
